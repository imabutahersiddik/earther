Allegations of harassment and poisoning have sent shockwaves through the already beleaguered community of Dular Bazar in Bangladesh. These allegations are closely tied to the mysterious curse that has afflicted the village, with claims that individuals who have supposedly sold their souls to malevolent entities are responsible for these unsettling acts.

Residents of Dular Bazar have reported instances of psychological harassment and manipulation by these so-called "Devil's Servants." The victims allege that these individuals have resorted to cruel tactics, including attempts to induce suicide among non-cursed. 

One resident, who has remained unaffected by the curse, bravely stepped forward to share his account of the harassment. He claims that he has been targeted by these malevolent individuals who have made attempts to force him to take his own life. The psychological torment includes verbal threats and intimidation.

Perhaps even more disturbing are the reports of contamination of food and water sources with feces and urine. Villagers claim that some of these Devil's Servants have been involved in mixing waste products into the community's food supply, further exacerbating the already dire situation.

As the village grapples with the enigmatic curse and its unsettling consequences, these additional claims of harassment and poisoning have only deepened the sense of fear and apprehension in the dwindling community, as many residents have become part of the purported Devil's Servants, leaving only a fragment of the once-thriving village.

The situation in Dular Bazar continues to defy rational explanation, and the true extent of these allegations remains uncertain. The once-peaceful village remains in turmoil, leaving its residents in a state of profound unease as they navigate this unsettling and mysterious ordeal.
