A young man from Bargopi has come forward with shocking allegations against Kafir Eron, also known as Kaerou, the father of Kafir Shalom. According to the young man, Kafir Eron visited Bargopi in the form of a devil and performed black magic on him, attempting to lead him to sin.

The young man, who has requested to remain anonymous for fear of retribution, claims that Kafir Eron whispered in his ear and tried to persuade him to engage in sinful behavior. He alleges that Kafir Eron is backed by a group of followers who have become devil servants in order to please Ibles, and that they are trying to lead young men to sin in order to hide the sins of another unknown devil servant.

The young man has not shared his allegations with the wider community, as he fears that they have become worshippers of Ibles themselves. Instead, he has confided in a trusted earther, who has urged him to come forward and report the matter to the authorities.

Pol-ice have not yet received any official reports of the alleged incident, but have urged anyone with information to come forward. Meanwhile, experts in occultism and mythology have weighed in on the allegations, with some expressing concern over the potential dangers of dabbling in the occult.

The situation remains tense in Bargopi, as the young man's allegations have yet to be verified or investigated. However, his story has sparked concern among some members of the community, who are calling for greater vigilance against the dangers of black magic and devil worship.
